# bannerMessage-module
A fork from the RRCHNM Donate module for Omeka S.

This module creates a heading across the top of every page in an Omeka S site which can serve as a content warning or similar purpose. At the moment, the message content is edited in the module code. Eventually I'll figure out how to make that something on the dashbaord.
